# quick git tutorial:
# To get other people's changes:
git pull // this may fail if you have local changes that are not pushed. If this happens, copy your repository to a backup and then do git reset --hard; git pull

# To save changes:
git add [filenames] // do this to the files you have modified.
git commit -m "[message]" // do this to give a message of what you changed in the files
git push origin master // do this to put your changes on github from your computer


# Useful tools:

git diff [filename] // Shows differences between your file and the committed one
git status // shows files that have changed on your local copy
git blame [filename] // shows who edited a line last
